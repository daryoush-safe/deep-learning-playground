The following notebook is meant to give a short introduction to PyTorch basics, and get you setup for writing your own neural networks. PyTorch is an open source machine/deep learning framework that allows you to write your own neural networks and optimize them efficiently. However, PyTorch is not the only framework of its kind. Alternatives to PyTorch include [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax#quickstart-colab-in-the-cloud) and [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/). We choose to teach PyTorch because it is well established, has a huge developer community (originally developed by Facebook), is very flexible and especially used in research. Many current papers publish their code in PyTorch, and thus it is good to be familiar with PyTorch as well.\n","Meanwhile, TensorFlow (developed by Google) is usually known for being a production-grade deep learning library. Still, if you know one machine/deep learning framework in depth, it is very easy to learn another one because many of them use the same concepts and ideas. For instance, TensorFlow's version 2 was heavily inspired by the most popular features of PyTorch, making the frameworks even more similar.\n","If you are already familiar with PyTorch and have created your own neural network projects, feel free to just skim this notebook.\n","\n","There are many great tutorials online, including the [\"60-min blitz\"](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) on the official [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/).\n","\n","We will use a set of standard libraries that are often used in machine/deep learning projects. We suggest you to upload and complete this notebook on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) because all libraries that you use are pre-installed on it."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":86,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"arxPzpkVGyQO","outputId":"2cef9438-4473-43fa-df35-56b71c23e8c0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1760643947911,"user_tz":-210,"elapsed":20,"user":{"displayName":"Daryoush Safe","userId":"09481010988996887516"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/tmp/ipython-input-47578708.py:11: DeprecationWarning: `set_matplotlib_formats` is deprecated since IPython 7.23, directly use `matplotlib_inline.backend_inline.set_matplotlib_formats()`\n","  set_matplotlib_formats('svg', 'pdf') # For export\n"]}],"source":["## Standard libraries\n","import os\n","import math\n","import numpy as np\n","import time\n","\n","## Imports for plotting\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","%matplotlib inline\n","from IPython.display import set_matplotlib_formats\n","set_matplotlib_formats('svg', 'pdf') # For export\n","from matplotlib.colors import to_rgba\n","import seaborn as sns\n","sns.set()\n","\n","## Progress bar\n","from tqdm.notebook import tqdm"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Lit_tD9VGyQQ"},"source":["## The Basics of PyTorch\n","\n","We will start with reviewing the very basic concepts of PyTorch.

iterable over a dataset with support for automatic batching, multi-process data loading and many more features. The data loader communicates with the dataset using the function `__getitem__`, and stacks its outputs as tensors over the first dimension to form a batch.\n","In contrast to the dataset class, we usually don't have to define our own data loader class, but can just create an object of it with the dataset as input. Additionally, we can configure our data loader with the following input arguments (only a selection, see full list [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader)):\n","\n","* `batch_size`: Number of samples to stack per batch\n","* `shuffle`: If True, the data is returned in a random order. This is important during training for introducing stochasticity.\n","* `num_workers`: Number of subprocesses to use for data loading. The default, 0, means that the data will be loaded in the main process which can slow down training for datasets where loading a data point takes a considerable amount of time (e.g. large images). More workers are recommended for those, but can cause issues on Windows computers. For tiny datasets as ours, 0 workers are usually faster.\n","* `pin_memory`: If True, the data loader will copy Tensors into CUDA pinned memory before returning them. This can save some time for large data points on GPUs. Usually a good practice to use for a training set, but not necessarily for validation and test to save memory on the GPU.\n","* `drop_last`: If True, the last batch is dropped in case it is smaller than the specified batch size. This occurs when the dataset size is not a multiple of the batch size.

However, PyTorch already provides a list of predefined loss functions which we can use (see [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#loss-functions) for a full list). For instance, for BCE, PyTorch has two modules: `nn.BCELoss()`, `nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()`. While `nn.BCELoss` expects the inputs $x$ to be in the range $[0,1]$, i.e. the output of a sigmoid, `nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss` combines a sigmoid layer and the BCE loss in a single class. This version is numerically more stable than using a plain Sigmoid followed by a BCE loss because of the logarithms applied in the loss function. Hence, it is adviced to use loss functions applied on \"logits\" where possible (remember to not apply a sigmoid on the output of the model in this case!).

If we would call the `backward` function on the loss while the parameter gradients are non-zero from the previous batch, the new gradients would actually be added to the previous ones instead of overwriting them.
